# LED-Test

We are a school-based FIRST Robotics Team from Kansas. Check out our website here: https://www.team1710.com/

This program contains command-based programming for various LED programs, including solid(), blink(), and others. You can shift them around for testing purposes in the LEDCommand folder. Use this as a springboard for your own ideas for LEDs!
